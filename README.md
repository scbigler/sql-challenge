# sql-challenge

This project represents the final submission for the  SQL-Challenge homework assignment for the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp, turned in by me, Sonny Bigler.

The EmployeeSQL folder contains the sql files that 1)create the tables and establish the constraints and 2) query the tables (total of 8 queries) that comprise the assiginment.  The folder also contains a .png image file of the ERD. 

The ERD was prepared using Quick Database Diagrams https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.  Additionally, QDD exported the SQL in Postgres flavor to generate the DDL used in PGAdmin to create the tables.  Data for each table was imported from csv files provided in the assignment.
